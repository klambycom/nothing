> Software Architecture Document (SAD)



## 1. Documentation Roadmap

### 1.1. How the SAD is Organized

This SAD is organized in three views, layered, logical and generalization view.
The layered view describes how the whole system is structured in layers and
serves as an introduction. The logical view describes the most important classes
and their organization in packages. The generalization view shows inheritance relations.

### 1.2. Stakeholder Representation

The stakeholders and the view of interest to them:

* Owner, layered view
* Architect, layered and generalization view
* Developer, logical and generalization view

### 1.3. How a View is Documented
